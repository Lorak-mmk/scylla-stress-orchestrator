Before you provision the environment, have a look at the the following file:

ec2-scylla/variables.tf

And modify the variables like the machine types etc.

To provision the environment, execute the following:

provision-terraform

The first time this script is called, it will create the following EC2 resources:
- security groups
- keypair
- the Scylla machine(s)
- Scylla monitor machine
- load generator machine(s).

To run the benchmark execute the following:

./benchmark.py

After the benchmark completes, you can find the results in the following directory:

trials/dummy-benchmark/

After you are finished with running your benchmark, you can destroy the environment using:

unprovision-terraform

This will destroy all the created EC2 resources. If you automatically want to destroy the 
environment after completing the benchmark, uncomment the last part of the benchmark.py file.
