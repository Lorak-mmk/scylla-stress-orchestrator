Before you provision the environment, have a look at the 

ec2-generic/variables.tf

and modify the variables.

To provisioner the environment:

provision-terraform

This will create the Scylla nodes, Scylla monitor and load generator machines.

The actual benchmark is in the 'benchmark.py'. Have a look at it and play 
with the cassandra-stress settings.

To run the benchmark:

./benchmark.py

After the benchmark completes, you can find the results in the following directory:

trials/dummy-benchmark/

After you are finished with benchmarks, you need to determine the environment using:

unprovision-terraform

This will remove all the created EC2 resources.
